## 1. Introduction
The **Rock and Mine Detection System** is designed to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy in underwater object detection, assisting naval operations and maritime safety.

## 2. Problem Statement
Underwater mine detection is a crucial task in naval defense and maritime safety. Traditional detection methods using sonar signals often require manual interpretation, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. A machine learning-based detection system can automate the classification process, improving accuracy and reducing risks.

## 3. Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to classify underwater objects as **rocks** or **mines**.
- Utilize sonar dataset features for precise classification.
- Provide an accessible system for maritime and defense applications.
- Deploy the model as a web-based or mobile application.

## 4. System Requirements
- **Hardware:**
  - Minimum 8GB RAM
  - At least 50GB storage space
  - GPU for model training (optional)
  
- **Software:**
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
  - Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, flask (for deployment)
  - IDE: VS Code, PyCharm (optional)

## 5. Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the **Sonar Dataset**, which contains sonar signal readings reflecting off different underwater objects.

### Key Features:
| Feature              | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 60 Frequency Values | Numerical values representing sonar signal strengths |
| Object Label        | **Rock (R) or Mine (M)** |

## 6. Data Preprocessing
To ensure data quality, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Checked for missing or null values and imputed where necessary.
2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Used all 60 numerical sonar readings for classification.
3. **Encoding Categorical Data:**
   - Converted the **Object Label** column into binary (Rock = 0, Mine = 1).
4. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize feature values.
5. **Data Splitting:**
   - Divided into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.

## 7. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques were applied to improve model performance:
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified redundant features to remove unnecessary attributes.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to extract significant features.
- **Data Augmentation:** Used synthetic data generation techniques to enhance training.

## 8. Model Selection
Various machine learning models were tested to find the best-performing classifier:
- **Logistic Regression:** A simple and interpretable model.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** A rule-based approach.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning technique.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Works well with high-dimensional data.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Based on feature similarity.
- **Neural Networks:** Used for deep learning-based classification.

## 9. Model Training and Evaluation
The models were trained and evaluated based on key metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.

### Performance Metrics
| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score | ROC-AUC |
|----------------------|---------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 88.2%   | 85.4%    | 86.8%  | 86.1%   | 90.2%   |
| Decision Tree       | 86.5%   | 84.9%    | 85.6%  | 85.2%   | 88.3%   |
| Random Forest      | 91.7%   | 90.5%    | 91.9%  | 91.2%   | 93.5%   |
| SVM                | 90.3%   | 89.1%    | 90.6%  | 89.8%   | 92.8%   |
| KNN                | 87.6%   | 85.8%    | 86.9%  | 86.3%   | 89.7%   |
| Neural Networks    | 93.1%   | 91.8%    | 93.5%  | 92.6%   | 95.2%   |

The **Neural Network** model performed the best, followed closely by the **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 10. Deployment Strategy
The trained model was deployed using Flask:
1. **Backend:** Flask API that takes input sonar readings and returns a prediction.
2. **Frontend:** A simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Hosting:** Deployed on **Heroku/AWS/GCP**.

### Steps to Run the Application Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rock-mine-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd rock-mine-detection
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask app:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open the browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## 11. Conclusion
This project successfully developed a **Rock and Mine Detection System** using machine learning. The deep learning model achieved the highest accuracy, making it a viable tool for assisting in maritime safety. Future improvements include:
- Integrating real-time sonar data processing.
- Deploying as a **mobile application** for easy access.
- Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
